# Messages

Message is a component in the Elm architecture. Messages are generated by the View in response to the user's interaction with the application's interface.Messages represent user requests to alter the application's state.

## Syntax 

```elm
--Message Syntax
type Message = some_message1 |some_message2 ...|some_messageN
```
## Illustration

The following example is a simple counter application. The application increments and decrements the value of a variable by 1 when the user clicks on the Add and Subtract buttons respectively.

The application will have 4 components - 

### Message
The messages for this example will be -

```elm

type Message =  Add | Subtract

```

### Model

The model represents the state of the applicaiton . In the counter application the model definition is given below ,initial state of counter will be zero.

```elm
model = 0
```

## View

 The view represents the visual elements of the application.The view contains two buttons **( + )** and **( - )** . The messages `Add` and `Subtract` are generated by the View when the user clicks on the `+` and `-` buttons respectively. The modified value of the model is then displayed by the View.

 ```elm
view model =
-- invoke text function
 h1[]
  [   div[] [text "CounterApp from TutorialsPoint" ]
      ,button[onClick Subtract] [text "-"]
      ,div[][text (toString  model)]
      ,button[onClick Add] [text "+"]
  ]

 ```
## Update

This component contains code that should be executed for each message generated by the view. This is shown in the example below :

```elm
   update msg model =
 case msg of
   Add -> model+1
   Subtract -> model-1
```

### Putting it all together

Step 1: Create a folder MessagesApp and file `MessagesDemo.elm`

Step 2: Add the following code in elm file

```elm
import Html exposing (..)
import Html.Events exposing(onClick)

model = 0     -- Defining the Model

--Defining the View

view model =  
 h1[]
  [   div[] [text "CounterApp from TutorialsPoint" ]
      ,button[onClick Subtract] [text "-"]
      ,div[][text (toString  model)]
      ,button[onClick Add] [text "+"]
  ]

--Defining the Messages

type Message =  Add | Subtract

--Defining Update

update msg model =
 case msg of 
   Add -> model+1
   Subtract -> model-1

-- Define the  main method
main =
   beginnerProgram
     {
         model=model
         ,view=view
         ,update=update
     }

```

Step 3:  Execute the elm make command in terminal. The elm make command compiles the code and generates an HTML file from the .elm file created above.

```elm
C:\Users\dell\elm\MessagesApp> elm make .\MessageDemo.elm
