# What is Elm 

- Strongly Typed Functional Language
- Developer Focused Design
- Useability
- Excellent tooling
- Thorough Documentation
- Friendly Error Messages
- Maintainability

Functional Languages have following features

1. Immutable
2. HighOrder Functions
3. Monads
4. Currying
5. Recursion
6. Folding
7. List,Set,Tuple
8. Pattern Matching

Elm contains all of these features , so its a pure functional programming language.Elm simplifies and abstracts away these concepts into the language so programmer doesn't get lost in the complex concepts.

Elm mainly targets front end developers.Elm helps programmers to debug code by giving very friendly error messages compared to other functional programming languages.

## Maintainability

- Static Type Checking

This help to check one version of library with another version of library.This is also called *automatic semantic versioning*.Elm package manager has rules build into it like

- what is major revision
- what is minor revision

This helps to publish library without breaking pervious versions.This helps to make resuable library using elm and deploy without breaking the previous versions.


### Features

- Pure fuctional

We don't have side effects.That is function receive an input and generates and output. In the middle they can't update things outside of themselves.

- Interop with JS

Elm is designed to interoperable with javascript.

- Virtual Dom
- Rich Error Messages
- Zero Runtime Exceptions
