# Commands

<!-- https://package.elm-lang.org/packages/elm/core/latest/Platform-Cmd -->
In the previous chapters, we discussed the various components of Elm architecture and their functions. The user and the application communicate with one another using Messages.  

Consider an example , where the application needs to communicate with some other components like an external server, APIs,microservice etc to serve the user request. This can be achieved by using Commands in Elm. Messages and commands are not synonymous. Messages represent the communication between an end user and the application while commands represent how an Elm application communicates with other entities. A command is triggered in response to a message. 

The following figure shows the workflow of a complex Elm application -

!["Commands"](https://github.com/kannans89/ElmRepo/blob/master/images/command.JPG?raw=true)

The user interacts with the view. The view generates an appropriate message based on the user's action. The update component receives  this message and triggers a command. 

## Syntax

The syntax for defining a command is as given below: 

```elm
 type Cmd msg
```
The message generated by the view is passed to the command.

<!--In our app so far we have ability for user and application to 
communicate with one antoher using Messages.The application 
build shows visual representation using views and then user
interacts with view by generating  messages.The message tells 
application how we want to update.-->

<!--Modern front end applications has to interact with not only users
it has to interact with other components with in the applications
itself for example making Http or Ajax requests or making
api calls etc.The way it should be done is through commands.
A command is triggered by a message.We will see an exmaple-->

## Illustration 

The following example,makes a request to an API and displays the result from the API.The application accepts a number from the user , passes itr to the Numbers API. This API returns facts related to the number.

The various components of the application are as follows:  

### Http Module

The Http Module of Elm is used to create and send HTTP requests. This module is not a part of the core module. We will use the elm package manager to install this package

### API
In this example the application will communicate with the Numbers API - "http://numbersapi.com/". This API is available freely.

## View
The application's view contains a textbox and a button.

```elm
view : Model -> Html Msg
view model =
  div []
    [ h2 [] [text model.heading]
    ,input [onInput Input, value model.input] []
    , button [ onClick ShowFacts ] [ text "show facts" ]
    , br [] []
    , h3 [][text model.factText]
    ]


```
## Model

The Model represents the value entered by the user  and the result that will be returned by the API.   

```elm
type alias Model =
  { heading : String
  , factText : String
  , input :String
  }

```

## Message
<!-- review this-->

The application has the following three messages- 

```elm

type Msg
  = ShowFacts
  |Input String
  | NewFactArrived (Result Http.Error String)

```

Onclick of the button `ShowFacts` message is passed to update method.When user types on textbox `Input` message is passsed to update method.Finally if
Http server response comes `NewFactArrived` message will be passed to update.

## Define update method

Note the update method returns a tuple which have model and command object.When user click on button the command passed is ShowFacts,
if showFacts then update method returns `(model, getRadmonNumberFromAPI model.input)`

```elm
update : Msg -> Model -> (Model, Cmd Msg)
update msg model =
  case msg of
    Input newInput ->
    (Model "NumbersApi typing.." "" newInput ,Cmd.none)
    ShowFacts ->
      (model, getRadmonNumberFromAPI model.input)

    NewFactArrived (Ok newFact) ->
      (Model "DataArrived" newFact "", Cmd.none)

    NewFactArrived (Err _) ->
      (model, Cmd.none)


```

## Http Server

the helper function to make http call to numberspi is shown below
The input parameter is String which is the number to search and the return type is command `Cmd Msg`

```elm
getRadmonNumberFromAPI : String->Cmd Msg
getRadmonNumberFromAPI newNo =
  let
    url =
      "http://numbersapi.com/"++newNo
  in
    Http.send NewFactArrived (Http.getString url)
```

|Sr No |  method    | Signature| Description
|:----:|:----------|:-------|:------------|
| 1| Http.getString|getString : String -> Request String|Create a GET request and interpret the response body as a String.
|2|Http.send |send:(Result Error a -> msg) -> Request a -> Cmd msg|Send a Http request

## Define main

```elm

main =
  Html.program
    { init = init
    , view = view
    , update = update
    , subscriptions = subscriptions
    }

```

## Example

step 1: create folder CommandApp and file CommandDemo.elm
step 2: 
Install http module using command `elm package install elm-lang/http`

step 3: Type the contents for CommandDemo.elm as shown

```elm

import Html exposing (..)
import Html.Attributes exposing (..)
import Html.Events exposing (..)
import Http


main =
  Html.program
    { init = init
    , view = view
    , update = update
    , subscriptions = subscriptions
    }

-- MODEL
type alias Model =
  { heading : String
  , factText : String
  , input :String
  }

init :  (Model, Cmd Msg)
init  =
  ( Model "NumbersAPI" "NoFacts" "42"-- set model two fields
  , Cmd.none  -- not to invoke api initially
  )


-- UPDATE

type Msg
  = ShowFacts
  |Input String
  | NewFactArrived (Result Http.Error String)


update : Msg -> Model -> (Model, Cmd Msg)
update msg model =
  case msg of
    Input newInput ->
    (Model "NumbersApi typing.." "" newInput ,Cmd.none)
    ShowFacts ->
      (model, getRadmonNumberFromAPI model.input)

    NewFactArrived (Ok newFact) ->
      (Model "DataArrived" newFact "", Cmd.none)

    NewFactArrived (Err _) ->
      (model, Cmd.none)



-- VIEW


view : Model -> Html Msg
view model =
  div []
    [ h2 [] [text model.heading]
    ,input [onInput Input, value model.input] []
    , button [ onClick ShowFacts ] [ text "show facts" ]
    , br [] []
    , h3 [][text model.factText]
    ]



-- SUBSCRIPTIONS


subscriptions : Model -> Sub Msg
subscriptions model =
  Sub.none



-- HTTP


getRadmon




FromAPI : String->Cmd Msg
getRadmonNumberFromAPI newNo =
  let
    url =
      "http://numbersapi.com/"++newNo
  in
    Http.send NewFactArrived (Http.getString url)

```

step 4: Fire the command `C:\Users\dell\elm\CommandApp> elm make .\CommandDemo.elm` this will generate the html file as shown below.
