# Introduction

Elm was Designed by Evan Czaplicki in 2012 . It is a functional programming language that compiles to javascript .It is also a  web frontend  framework which is fast,testable,maintainable, and with no Runtime exceptions. In javascript errors because of  `null or undefined , undefined is not a function ` are very common and hard to debug.This is where elm comes in

## Why Elm

Elm eliminates most of the common problems faced by frontend developers.This include

### 1. No Runtime Exceptions

 In Elm it is extremely common to have no runtime exceptions.Instead of runtime exceptions, you have compile time errors.Elm ensures that errors will happen only at compile time.

### 2. Developer friendly error messages

 Elm's compiler is designed to provide very specific and human-friendly compile time errors to developers unlike other languages.They also tend to include hints such as links to recommended design documentations

### 3. Easy Refactoring

Elm is statically typed language .It is easier to write  tests by isolating one function from another in Elm.Elm’s types ensure that you won’t break anything when you need to make a big change. This make it easy to make changes in large codebase.

### 4. Sematic Versioning

Elm emphasis on maintainability means you don’t have to worry that beginners will silently break existing codebases. This is achieved as Elm packages are automatically enforced to semantic versioning.

### 5. Reusable Code

 Elm functions are inherently easy to reuse,compared to functions in JavaScript, Python, or TypeScript.
